# MentorAI - Intelligent Educational Assistant 🤖📚

An AI-powered educational chatbot designed to help students learn independently rather than simply providing ready-made answers.

## 🎯 Project Overview

MentorAI addresses a common problem in modern education: while students increasingly use AI chatbots like GPT to get quick answers, teachers are concerned that this approach doesn't promote genuine learning. MentorAI takes a different approach by guiding students to find solutions themselves rather than copying AI-generated answers.

- Teaches research methodology

### 📋 Step-by-Step Guidance
- Offers detailed action plans and instructions for complex problems
- Breaks down difficult tasks into manageable steps
- Provides structured learning paths

### 💡 Educational Explanations
- Explains concepts and materials in an accessible way
- Answers questions with educational context

- Resists pressure to provide direct answers
- Consistently guides students toward self-discovery

## 🚀 How It Works
